Towers-of-Hanoi-Vector-cpp
==========================

You are given three towers a, b, and c. We start with n rings on tower 'a' and 
we need to transfer them to tower 'b' subject to some restrictions: <br>
1. We can only move one ring at a time, and <br>
2. We may never put a larger numbered ring on top of a smaller numbered
one. <br>
There are always 3 towers. 

Input:
======
This program will prompt the user for the
number of rings.

Output:
=======
Set of Autogenerated Instructions produced by the program by using non recursive algorithm 
to transfer rings from one tower to the other two towers
